# Hi!

I'm a second-year PhD student at the Computer Science Department, HKUST. My research interests include machine learning systems, large language models (LLM), generative inference, and LLM pre-training. Before joining to HKUST, I was an undergraduate at Peking University.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Binhang Yuan](https://binhangyuan.github.io/site/) of Relaxed System Lab from HKUST.

For more information about my publications, cv, etc., please check out corresponding pages.
